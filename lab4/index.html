					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Restate the challenge of the lab here.</p> The challenge was this goal was to devise a sequence of routine tasks and outline the necessary steps to ensure their accurate completion. This process involved initially drafting the list using pseudocode, a method that combines natural language with programming structures for clarity. 
					Once the pseudocode was finalized, it was subsequently translated into JavaScript, allowing it to function as executable instructions within a web environment.

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>What problems arose? How did you solve them? </p>  We where discussing about whether we needed to fully code the tic-tac-toe game for our website or just put together a list of steps on how to play it. 
					The example code was really close to what our assignment required, which kind of led to our debate. In the end, we decided to go with just listing steps since it's all about pseudocoding.
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2> Lab 4 was a great experience for our team, as it helped us grasp how important it is to organize our thoughts when tackling a problem and translating that into coding. 
					It's all about carefully planning each step so we can smoothly convert our ideas into JavaScript code, and doing this together made the whole process feel more manageable and enjoyable.

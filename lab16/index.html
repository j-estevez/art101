                <h2>Challenge</h2>
                <p>
                    The callenge of this lab would be trying to figure out whats the code we need to actually make the code work.
                    <br>
                    We spend much more time in this lab than other becuase none of the them have any "Getting Started," "Tutorial,"  "How To Use," or "Examples."
                </p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="minor-section">
                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p>
                    The main problem encountered was dealing with CORS restrictions that was never mention by the lecture, or by XKCD. 
                    <br>
                    So we have to search up whatsw wrong and why does knowledge wer learned in the lecture doesn't work.

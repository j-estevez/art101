					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenges would be trying to understand team building skill as we help each other understand HTMl and CSS as a team. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Some problems we found when doing the site would be that when tryng to upload an image up to the website, it appeared as an broken image.
						We tried all we could like changing the file type or rechecking all the work we did and it did not work. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>The prohject goes very well, we might encounter some issues while working but we all have understand HTML and CSS better during the lab.
						We make sure we contunue the work with a positive energy. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>
						Overall the porject went pretty well, we have a lot of thought about what should we do other than introducing ourselves.
						But we both think introducting Jeffery's cat would be interesting.

					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of Lab 2 was to understanding team building skills as we help each other understand HTML and CSS as a team.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>A problem that arose from this lab was having an jpg image show up in our website. Siyan was well familar with coding and followed the step correctly to proplery add an image. <br>
					However, it was unsuccessful. We asked for help on discord, but no reply. We decide that we will ask the TA during section. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>The lab was very straight forward, Siyan was very helpful towards explaining certain parts of process in HTML and CSS to Jeffrey. <BR>
					We where able to properly introduce ourself while working in the lab. Postive vibes!!! XD  </p>

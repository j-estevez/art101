			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Some challeng that I encounter when doing the lab would be trying to make sure the id function in index and css.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Some problem I encounter during the lab would be how long it would take for Visual Code to send the information to Github to update our Github link. It took longer then expect and we thought that we did something wrong with code. Eventually, the Github link will update as we wait around 4-5 mins. 
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Lab 3 went very well for our team. We where able to help each other solve the file structure and file transfer together. 
						We were pretty postive with result outcome of our work.
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>
						Overall, Lab 3 was very straight forward for our team to understand and perform. Trial and error is expected to understand the Lab 3 as we learn from the experience.
